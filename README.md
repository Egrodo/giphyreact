# GIF Search / Trending
This is a GIF search / trending display webapp created using React, Semantic UI, and the Giphy API. The purpose of this project was to learn how to use Giphy as well as gain more experience with progressive web apps including async / await and lazy loading. 

The application boasts a fully-featured searching dialogue with slide-show (or arrow keyed) navigation, responsive design, and infinite scrolling.
